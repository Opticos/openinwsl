## GWSL Not Working After Updates?
* Simply go to the GWSL Dashboard --> About --> Allow GWSL through the firewall, and follow the instructions.
* If this does not help, verify GWSL PulseAudio Server and GWSL VcXsrv windows xserver HIDPI (And LOWDPI) are allowed public access.
* Still no success? See below, you have another issue.
