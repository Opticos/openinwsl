## OpenInWSL

### What does OpenInWSL do?
OpenInWSL lets you set WSL Linux apps as File Handlers in Windows.

No more crazy custom code and batch files! Make any Linux app open any file directly from the File Explorer with one click!

Even more Windows to WSL integration!

Features:
* Supports adding an "Open In WSL" item to the File Explorer context menu.

* Supports being set as a file handler for any format.

* Lets you create and manage associations to forward different windows file types to any Linux program.

* OpenInWSL Integrates with GWSL, wslg, and any other xservers. (GWSL is recommended). OpenInWSL does not provide graphics.

Basically, OpenInWSL lets you replace something like notepad.exe with gedit in WSL for opening text files. In this case Windows will now automatically open text files in gedit!
This is especially useful if you use WSL Linux-based IDE's to edit files stored on Windows. No more opening the WSL shell to anually open the file. 

Just click it! (Or right click and select "Open In WSL" if you want to use a Windows IDE too!)
